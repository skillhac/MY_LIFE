          <p>
            I was born into a body that challenged life even before I understood
            what life was, born with spina bifida, spinal deformities, a
            neurogenic bladder, scoliosis, three kidneys, and a severely
            underdeveloped right leg, and from my very first breath, survival
            became my daily language;
          </p>

          <p>
            my childhood was not measured in birthdays or school terms but in
            hospital rooms, operation theaters, medical reports, scars, needles,
            and the quiet fear in my parents’ eyes as doctors spoke in clinical
            tones about probabilities and risks,
          </p>

          <p>
            and while other children learned how to walk freely, I learned how
            to endure pain, how to stay still during procedures, how to accept
            catheters and tubes that forced me to urinate through plastic lines,
            stealing dignity at an age when innocence should have been
            protected,
          </p>

          <p>
            yet even then I learned self-reliance because my body demanded it,
            and school did not offer refuge either, because classrooms were not
            built for bodies like mine nor minds shaped by pain, and I carried
            my differences on my skin and in my posture, feeling the weight of
            stares, whispers, isolation, and the silent cruelty of being treated
            as fragile or invisible, struggling to focus while my body ached and
            my mind fought battles no child should fight,
          </p>

          <p>
            and by the age of eight, after countless surgeries and relentless
            suffering, my right leg was amputated, a moment that many would call
            an ending but for me became a turning point, because something
            inside me hardened into resolve, and instead of shrinking, I chose
            motion,
          </p>

          <p>
            choosing to cycle not for medals but for freedom, pedaling through
            pain and doubt as every rotation of the wheel reminded me that
            movement was rebellion and balance was power,
          </p>

          <p>
            and surgeries continued, pain never left, kidney failure entered my
            life, dialysis chained me to machines, and later a renal transplant
            rewrote my relationship with mortality, forcing me to live
            immunosuppressed, always cautious, always aware that life could
            change overnight,
          </p>

          <p>
            and emotionally there were nights of fear, frustration, anger,
            loneliness, and questioning my own existence, moments where my mind
            felt heavier than my body,
          </p>

          <p>
            yet somewhere between scars and survival I made a choice not to let
            suffering define the size of my dreams, and that choice led me to
            the sky,
          </p>

          <p>
            where against logic, statistics, and expectations I became a
            skydiver, paragliding pilot, and scuba diver without a prosthetic
            leg, learning to adapt my body to freefall, to understand
            aerodynamics with one leg, to trust myself while gravity made no
            exceptions,
          </p>

          <p>
            jumping from 13,000 feet not because I was fearless but because fear
            no longer controlled me, finding in the sky a freedom I had never
            known on land, becoming one of the world’s youngest amputee
            skydivers, not chasing records but reclaiming ownership over my body
            and my story,
          </p>

          <p>
            and along the way I became a survivor of kidney failure, a licensed
            skydiver with over a hundred jumps, a motivational speaker, an
            adaptive athlete, a filmmaker, and a storyteller,
          </p>

          <p>
            but achievements were never the purpose, because my real mission is
            larger than personal success,
          </p>

          <p>
            it is to create access where there was exclusion, dignity where
            there was dependence, and paths where there were walls, to build
            legs not just as prosthetics but as possibilities,
          </p>

          <p>
            to give children and adults like me freedom without permission, to
            stand beside those who still urinate through tubes, who hide scars
            under clothes, who live with chronic pain, emotional trauma, and
            mental exhaustion,
          </p>

          <p>
            and tell them that their body is not their limitation, that pain
            does not cancel purpose, and that survival itself is a powerful
            qualification,
          </p>

          <p>
            because my life is not a story of inspiration meant to make others
            feel momentarily hopeful, it is a statement of resistance against a
            world that underestimates differently-abled bodies,
          </p>

          <p>
            and everything I do now is guided by that belief, whether I am
            flying, speaking, creating, or dreaming of even higher skies,
          </p>

          <p>because I exist to show that freedom is not given, it is taken,</p>

          <p>
            and this journey, from hospital beds to open skies, from tubes to
            turbulence, from pain to purpose, is only the beginning of what I am
            here to build and give back to the world,
          </p>

          <p>and my story, my work, and my mission live on</p>
        </div>
